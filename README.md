<p align="left">Have you ever wondered if you could eat something from the supermarket? Have you ever checked the list of the ingredients of the products you want to buy? At least you have allergies or intolerances, we don’t think you had really often! Vegans and vegetarians do this all the time. We wanted to make this little daily challenge easier. We provided a tool that uses the camera, scans the labels of the products in real time and gives you instant feedback if that product contains non-vegan ingredients. The app gives you the opportunity to have a shopping list in the App, so that vegans have everything they could possibly want for grocery shoppings, in one hand. What our app has more than others already in the market? It works offline, seen that many supermarkets don’t have internet connection inside. It works for vegans and their network, providing a tool they can use to connect and improve their daily life.</p>
